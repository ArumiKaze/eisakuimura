            <k>Encourage your warrior to fight well and intimidate your adversary by playing the Taiko or Shakuhachi better than your opponent!</k>
            <br />
            <k>In this game, you have to play the Taiko and Shakuhachi in time for your warrior to win the battle. Warriors will take turns playing 
            a series of beats in the form of tomoe symbols to deal damage to the opposing warrior. If a warrior plays all the notes right, the player 
            will gain a morale boost and deal damage based on how much morale they currently have. On the other hand if the player misses a note or a 
            couple of notes, the player will lose morale based on how much they missed and deal damage based on the newly decreased morale. To win the 
            duel, the player with the lowest health will lose either at the end of the song or when their health is below 0.</k>
            <br />
            <k>Inspiration for this game came from traditional Japanese culture. The gameplay or setting came from the Total War:Shogun 2 intro cinematic 
            where two master warriors duel to the death. The art was inspired by old sumi-e paintings.</k>

            <l>At first, the prototype looked like this. This was not an actual game and was just made to illustrate and brainstorm how the game would 
            look and play. There would be two opposing sides with their own respective health and morale bar. Each player would take turns playing an 
            instrument that appears on a scroll. This idea was pitched to a group of people and the project was able to acquire a new team member, an 
            artist, to immediately work on the alpha build.</l>

            <j>Arduino and Processing was used to build the game. To create the Taiko (drums), we used Piezo discs to detect vibrations/hits from the player. 
            Plastic baskets were used to imitate the drums and the discs were inserted under the basket where the player will hit the drum. Alpha was a success 
            in that it was built in a week and the game worked. Players were able to hit the drums and play the rhythm correctly on screen to do damage to the
            other player.</j>

                For the final build, we focused on polish and adding the Shakuhachi (flute) into the game. Polish was basically making the gameplay feel smooth
                and not frustrating. We had a lot of feedback on our game and we utilized that to make the drums more responsive and added visual indicators so 
                that players can tell whether they hit a note correctly or not. More art was implemented to the game to give it a nice polished look and we finished 
                mapping the entire length of the song. The flute is our most recent addition to the game and we used photoresistors (light detectors) to imitate the finger covering the 
                holes on the flute. The photoresistors were placed in each of the flute's holes and we sucessfully detected input from the flute to add another element
                to the overall gameplay.
